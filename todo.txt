* Issues 
- There's apparently a issue with NextJS building everything, it seems like it's trying to create a new model whenever I use any function from UserModel. This is fixed exporting the already created model

- NextApiRequest
I had to find out how to merge some more types to the NextApiRequest for a piece of code that required it in strict typescript

- localStorage
had to write checks to localStorage availability due to server side rendering of nextjs
Window, and document are not available on the server. This is why you'll run into these types of errors if you are trying to access window properties or document.
In my case, I was persisting my authentication token to localStorage on the previous application.

To avoid running into these undefined errors at compile and build time, you can run a simple check.

- Font change tailwind
The "extend" functionality allows you to add your font(s) alongside the existing font utilities.

Add a theme.extend.fontFamily section to your Tailwind config

- Type safety with extraReducers
Was getting an error regarding putting a promise inside a redux state. Resolved it by searching through the redux toolkit documentation and correctly making "action" type safe.
